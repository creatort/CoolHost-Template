# CoolHost: Modern Host Landing Page.

CoolHost is a little one-page template for simple host landing pages. 
It runs on Bootstrap 5 and is pretty light to use so you could just stick it up on your webserver and have a functional landing page for your hosting service.

Please leave the note in the footer which annotes I created the page, don't remove it.
If you have found someone has removed it, feel free to open an Issue Request on [This Repo](https://github.com/creatort/CoolHost-Template/issues)

Feel free to customize everything else to your liking.
